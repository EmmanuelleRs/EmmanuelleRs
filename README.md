I'm a self-taught software engineer, I studied Math and Physics career at IPN Mexico, and I found my passion for software development after taking a programming course in Python. This passion relies on finding the best solution to problems using math and logic. As a self-taught software engineer, I practice and study everyday topics about data structures, design patterns, software development, and so forth. It helps me to stay competitive and write scalable and reliable software
